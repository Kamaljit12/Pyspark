# Important Questions and answers

The difference between RDD and DataFrame is a common question in Spark. RDD stands for Resilient Distributed Dataset, which is a distributed collection of data elements that can be stored in memory or disk across a cluster of nodes. DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns, similar to a table in a relational database or a spreadsheet.

## Main differences between RDD and DataFrame are:

- ### Data Representation:
  - RDD can handle both structured and unstructured data,
  - whereas DataFrame can only handle structured and semi-structured data.
  
- ### Data Format:
  - RDD can accept data from various sources, such as HDFS, local file system, or relational databases.
  - DataFrame can also accept data from various sources, but it requires a schema to define the types and names of the columns.
- ### Immutability and Interoperability:
  - RDD is immutable, which means it cannot be modified once created. DataFrame is also immutable, but it can be easily converted to and from RDD.
  - DataFrame also supports interoperability with SQL, Python, R, and Scala.
  
- ### Optimization:
  - RDD does not have a built-in optimization engine, and each RDD is optimized individually.
  - DataFrame has a built-in optimization engine called Catalyst, which can perform query optimization, code generation, and execution planning.
  
- ### Serialization: 
  - RDD uses Java serialization to encode data, which is expensive and slow.
  - DataFrame uses in-memory serialization, which reduces the overhead and improves performance.
- ### Schema Projection:
  - RDD requires manual schema definition,
  - whereas DataFrame can automatically discover the schema from the data source.
- ### Aggregation:
  - RDD is hard and slow to perform simple aggregations and grouping operations,
  - whereas DataFrame is fast and easy to perform exploratory analysis and aggregated statistics on large datasets.

# Spark architecture

Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides a way to perform fast, distributed computing on big data collections. The architecture of Apache Spark can be described in terms of its major components:

1. Spark Driver:
   - The driver is the central coordinator of the Spark application. It converts the user's code into tasks that can be executed on the cluster. The driver communicates with the cluster manager and is responsible for translating the userâ€™s program into a logical and physical execution plan.

2. Spark Context:
   - Within the driver, the SparkContext is the heart of any Spark application. It establishes a connection to the Spark execution environment. It's responsible for making RDDs available to every node in the Spark cluster.

3. Cluster Manager:
   - The Spark context connects to cluster managers, such as YARN, Mesos, or Spark's standalone manager. The cluster manager allocates resources needed by Spark applications.

4. Worker Nodes:
   - Worker nodes are the nodes that perform the data processing. Each worker node has one or more Executors.

5. Executors:
   - Executors are agents that run on the worker nodes and execute the tasks. They report the status of the computation back to the driver node.

6. Tasks:
   - A task is a unit of work that is sent to the executor. Each stage of a Spark job can have multiple tasks, each of which processes data in a partition and computes a result.

The data processing model of Spark is mainly based on RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets), which are immutable distributed collections of objects. Operations on RDDs can be distributed across the nodes of the cluster and are performed in parallel. Spark has built-in modules for SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing, which are built on top of RDDs.

Data Processing in Spark occurs in stages, and stages are divided into tasks. When an action (like count or collect) is called on the RDD, the SparkContext hands the job over to the DAGScheduler. The DAGScheduler creates a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of tasks that need to be executed. The DAGScheduler partitions the graph into stages that have tasks that can be executed in parallel. The TaskScheduler then launches tasks via cluster manager resources (like YARN or Mesos executors). The executors then run the tasks and save the results.

To handle fault tolerance, Spark uses lineage information of the RDDs, so that if any partition of an RDD is lost, it can be recomputed from the original one using the lineage graph of the RDDs.

Spark's architecture supports both batch and interactive queries and computations, with libraries like Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLlib, and GraphX enriching its core capabilities and offering solutions for structured data processing, real-time analytics, machine learning, and graph processing, respectively.
